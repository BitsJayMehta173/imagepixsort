# IMAGE PIXEL SORT (BUCKET SORT MODIFICATION) USING IMAGE PIXELS

## Using Image to sort the array for recognisation of partnership model where even with parallel process and GPU rendering can sort out the array utilizing the common process two different process combines together in this method where one is processing the image just like in games where he needs to do the analysis which makes uses of the images and this algorithm utilizes it

## for now we have seen the algorithm 10 times slower than the inbuilt sorting method present in the python
## but as two jobs are done with energy used by one it is beneficial

## In Image You have flexibility to use the bucket sort accordingly like instead of using integer you can use colours to store frequency
## We can make unique design for our bucket sort for e.g you can make a circular buckets for some custom modification

## This method helps us for template in bucket sort and customization over bucket sort in visual format
